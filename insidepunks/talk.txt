The Making of Punk Pixel Heads / Portraits

- Hand-Drawn?
- 1 of 1s (1/1s)?
- Who's the Artist?


A:

- Computer-Generated Images
- No 1/1s (All Punk Head / Portrait Images Pasted Together Using 133 Building Block Images e.g. Female Light, Wild Blonde, Hot Lipstick, etc.)
- No A.I. (Artificial Intelligence "Machine Learning Models")

Addendum 1)

What if - What if you paint a 24x24 punk "by hand" as a 1/1 from scratch / zero?
  Who owns the copyright? The artist?


Addendum 2)

Punk Trivia - In August 2021
Matt & John's published
all punk image building blocks
on the  permissionless
decentralized blockchain (shared public database).

See Inside the CryptoPunksData Contract - Decoding the On-Blockhain Assets (11 Archetypes and 122 Attributes) and Color Palette for Easy (Re)Use "Off-Blockchain"

<https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/punks.sandbox/tree/master/punksdata>


Can You Copyright Transaction Data?
The punk image building blocks (133 "assets") are NOT published in the (open) contract code
but added one-by-one via public and signed addAsset transactions / function calls.
Example:

tx id   - function call
0x8972c6b4a44c972111bf18feccae7cfb26db615be400d1422c0763a1a2b03af5 addAsset     : 18,0x6726f0,Clown Nose
